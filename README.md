# Display-Characters-from-A-to-Z-Using-Loop
In this example, we are using a for loop to print alphabets from ‘A’ to ‘Z’. We have a char type variable ch, which is initialized with the value ‘A’ and incremented by 1 on every loop iteration. At every loop iteration, the value of ch is printed. The loop ends when the variable ch prints ‘Z’.
